1. Language: the project was coded in Python 3.8 (Jupyter notebook).
2. Codes: has been stored in the link:https://github.com/Hanlarious/ML/tree/main/A2
	These Four Jupyter notebooks have all the codes.
	


	The codes have been processed, and are showing all the results.
		1) "4peaks.ipynb", "FlipFlop.ipynb", and "MaxKColor.ipynb" contains the code for the first part;
		2) "ANN.ipynb" contains the code for the second part.

3. Libraries: mlrose_hiive, sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
4. Data set: has been stored in the same repo with the codes.
		1) "Phishing.csv"
5. How to run code:
	1) put all five documents in one folder (at least "Phishing.csv" should be placed in the same file with "ANN.ipynb");
	2) open Jupyter notebook and find the folder location;
	3) you can either run them line by line by pressing Shift+Enter or choose to Run All.
6. Other documents contained in the repo:
		1) "pics" -- a file folder contains all the graphs I used in my report
