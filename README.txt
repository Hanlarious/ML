1. Language: the project was coded in Python 3.8 (Jupyter notebook).
2. Codes: has been stored in the link:
	These two Jupyter notebooks have all the codes.
	Each Jupyter notebook document contains five algorithms for one data set.
	The codes have been processed, and are showing all the results.
		1) "satisfaction.ipynb"
		2) "Phishing.ipynb"
3. Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
4. Data sets: have been stored in the same repo with the codes.
		1) "test.csv"
		2) "Phishing.csv"
5. How to run code:
	1) put all four documents in one folder;
	2) open Jupyter notebook and find the folder location;
	3) you can either run them line by line by pressing Shift+Enter or choose to Run All.
6. Other documents contained in the repo:
		1) "graphs" -- a file folder contains all the graphs I used in my report
		2) "excel_result.xlsx" -- a complete record of the model fitting results
