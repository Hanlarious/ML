1. Language: the project was coded in Python 3.8 (Jupyter notebook).
2. Codes: has been stored in the link:https://github.com/Hanlarious/ML/tree/main/A2
	There are six Jupyter notebooks containing all the codes:
	1)"Phishing-cluster.ipynb" ---- all clustering codes for the phishing dataset
	2)"Satisfaction_cluster.ipynb" ---- all clustering codes for the satisfaction dataset (imbalanced but scaled)
	3)"Satisfaction_cluster_balanced.ipynb" ---- all clustering codes for the satisfaction dataset (balanced and scaled)
	4)"Satisfaction_reduced.ipynb"---- all clustering codes for the satisfaction dataset (balanced, categorical features dropped, and scaled)
	5)"School.ipynb" ---- all clustering codes for the school dataset
	6)"NN-satisfaction.ipynb" ---- all the neural network codes (satisfaction dataset) 	
	
	The codes have been processed, and are showing all the results.


3. Libraries: sklearn, yellowbrick, seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas.
4. Data set: has been stored in the same repo with the codes.
	1)"Phishing.csv" ---- for phishing dataset
	2)"Satisfaction.csv" ---- for satisfaction dataset
	3)"schoolpredict.csv" ---- fort school dataset
5. How to run code:
	1) put all nine(9) documents in one folder;
	2) open Jupyter notebook and find the folder location;
	3) you can either run them line by line by pressing Shift+Enter or choose to Run All.
6. Other documents contained in the repo:
	1) "graphs" -- a file folder contains all the graphs I used in my report
